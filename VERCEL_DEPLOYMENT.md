# Vercel Deployment Guide for MODZY

This project has been fully migrated from cPanel hosting to Vercel. All cPanel-specific configurations have been removed and replaced with Vercel-optimized settings.

## Migration Summary

### Removed cPanel-Specific Files:
- ✅ `.htaccess` files (root and public directory)
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` (cPanel deployment guide)
- ✅ Windows-specific build commands
- ✅ cPanel-specific post-build scripts

### Added Vercel Configuration:
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Complete Vercel configuration
- ✅ `.vercelignore` - Deployment exclusions
- ✅ Updated `package.json` scripts for Vercel
- ✅ Security headers migrated to Vercel format
- ✅ Caching rules optimized for Vercel
- ✅ `src/config/domain.js` - Dynamic domain configuration
- ✅ Updated all hardcoded domain references to use dynamic config
- ✅ Made URLs relative for better Vercel compatibility

## Prerequisites
- Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. Deploy from project directory:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to configure your project

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your Git repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect it's a React app
5. Click "Deploy"

## Configuration Details

### Build Settings

### Environment Variables
If you have any environment variables, add them in the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add your variables for Production, Preview, and Development

### Custom Domain Configuration
Since you're using the same domain (modzy.in), you'll need to:
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains in Vercel
2. Add your custom domain: `modzy.in`
3. Update your DNS records to point to Vercel:
   - Add A record: `@` → `76.76.19.61`
   - Add CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. Vercel will automatically provision SSL certificate

4. Monitor performance in Vercel dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
